		<p class="border" >As expected, Enola Holmes is Netflix’s  top-rated movie or TV show at the moment, using its Wednesday launch to build word-of-mouth for the kid-friendly adventure flick heading into the weekend. And yes, it is a very kid-friendly movie, offering its spirited young heroine (Millie Bobby Brown, relishing her first uncontested starring role amid her producing debut) solving the mystery of her mother’s disappearance and unraveling another conspiracy with graver implications. Like Disney’s  live-action Mulan and Orion’s Bill & Ted Face the Music over the last few weeks, it’s another case of a very “PG” movie inexplicably being awarded a PG-13 for no good reason.  </p>

		<h2>Academy Explains Diversity Rules for Best Picture Oscar</h2>
		<p>Two academy governors — the producer DeVon Franklin and Paramount Pictures’ chairman and chief executive, Jim Gianopulos — headed up the task force to develop the standards. They took their inspiration from the British Film Institute, which in 2019 became the first major awards body to introduce diversity and inclusion criteria as part of its eligibility requirements.</p>
